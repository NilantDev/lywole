First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on

Nah, nah, yeah
(Cake by the ocean)
Oh, no
See you walkin' 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl, why those feet cold?
We just gettin' started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe (ah)
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh)
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me (ah-ah-ah)
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy (huh)
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet-sweet cravin', whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fuckin' crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Goddamn
See you lickin' frostin' from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm beggin', "Yes, ma'am"
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, ooh
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously (whoa-oh)
Let's lose our minds and go fuckin' crazy (ah)
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Ooh, ah-ah
Hey, you're fuckin' delicious
Talk to me, girl
Talk to me, baby (talk to me, baby)
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (hey) (uh)
Let's lose our minds and go (and go what?), fuckin' crazy (that's right)
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' (I'm ready), we'll eat cake by the ocean (ah, yeah)
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready, I need it every night
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)

Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic)
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm.

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never, baby
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever, every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
I'm levitating (whoo)
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (whoo)
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my arse off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
I got you (yeah), moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night (all night), come on, dance with me
You can fly away with me tonight (tonight)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (take you for a ride)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (let me take you for a ride)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (you are my starlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (come on, dance with me, baby)

Hiya, Barbie
Hi, Ken
You want to go for a ride?
Sure, Ken
Jump in
I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on, Barbie, let's go party
I'm a blonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make it tight, I'm your dolly
You're my doll, rock'n'roll, feel the glamour in pink
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
You can touch
You can play
If you say, "I'm always yours" (ooh, oh)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again
Hit the town, fool around, let's go party
If you say, "I'm always yours"
Oh, I'm having so much fun
Well, Barbie, we're just getting started
Oh, I love you, Ken
